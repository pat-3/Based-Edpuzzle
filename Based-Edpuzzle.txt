This is the gist of "Based-Edpuzzle":
    -is like Edpuzzle in that its purpose is to make the user watch a video while it is focused on the screen
    -Utilizes python so the user has to maintain eyecontact with the screen while the video is running, otherwise it pauses it.
    -Should utilize a pre-built library like this: https://github.com/stepacool/Eye-Tracker
