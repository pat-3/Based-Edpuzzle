This is the gist of "Based-Edpuzzle":
    -is like Edpuzzle in that its purpose is to make the user watch a video while it is focused on the screen
    -Utilizes python so the user has to maintain eyecontact with the screen while the video is running, otherwise it pauses it.
    -Should utilize a pre-built library like this: https://github.com/stepacool/Eye-Tracker
    
Here are the requirements:
    -Create an app that plays through a list of .mp4, .avi, .wmv, or youtube videos
        -UX/UI shows list of videos
    -Focus: if user 
        -clicks off of player than the video stops
        -Disallow fast forwarding
    -Focus: Eye tracking
        -if user looks away from screen than player stops
        -player resumes if user looks back at screen
    -Connect player to cloud, firebase, aws, or azure. Records user data when video is completed
